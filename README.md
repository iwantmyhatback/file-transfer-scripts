# tcp-file-transfer

Simple bash scripts to be used on two machines to facilitate a file transfer using netcat and tcp protocol, just uploaded these so i dont have to keep writing them every time i need to use them.

Files will need to be given permissions using `chmod 775 send` or `chmod 775 receive`
